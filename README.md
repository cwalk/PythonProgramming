# PythonProgramming
During my Intro to C programming class at UCF, our class was tested in using Python. Here are some Python programs I wrote as I was learning to program.

##Usage

Clone the repo using `git clone https://github.com/cwalk/PythonProgramming`

Navigate into the project directory and run the individual python programs with `python [filename].py`

Python-1 and Python-2 have different programs inside them, and descriptions of what each program does can be found in Python-1.pdf and Python-2.pdf respectively.
